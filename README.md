# Beijing-Multi-Site-Air-Quality

Motivation
Air pollution refers to the release of pollutants into the air that are detrimental to human health and the planet as a whole. It has been proven through studies that air pollution directly affects the temperature of a location. Energy production and transportation are one of the major causes of air pollution. The burning of fossil fuels leads to release of various harmful and hazardous chemicals into the atmosphere. These chemicals along with pressure, wind, altitude and oceanic movement affect the temperature of a specific location. The main aim of this project is to analyze the relation between temperature and concentration of some of these pollutants in the atmosphere. Moreover, this project also emphasizes on the importance of Feature Creation in Data Mining.

Objective
The main objective of this project is to predict the PM 2.5 levels in the air to determine the Air quality of Beijing.

Problem description:

Your goal is to predict the PM 2.5 levels in the air to determine the Air quality of Beijing. There are multiple datasets concerning different districts in Beijing. The data was recorded hourly for each district.Throughout, missing values have been filled as NaNs.

Dataset Description: This data set includes hourly air pollutants data from 12 nationally-controlled air-quality monitoring sites. The air-quality data are from the Beijing Municipal Environmental Monitoring Center. The meteorological data in each air-quality site are matched with the nearest weather station from the China Meteorological Administration. The time period is from March 1st, 2013 to February 28th, 2017. Missing data are denoted as NA.

The features in this dataset are provided as following

No: row number

year: year of data in this row

month: month of data in this row

day: day of data in this row

hour: hour of data in this row

PM2.5: PM2.5 concentration (ug/m^3)

PM10: PM10 concentration (ug/m^3)

SO2: SO2 concentration (ug/m^3)

NO2: NO2 concentration (ug/m^3)

CO: CO concentration (ug/m^3)

O3: O3 concentration (ug/m^3)

TEMP: temperature (degree Celsius)

PRES: pressure (hPa)

DEWP: dew point temperature (degree Celsius)

RAIN: precipitation (mm)

wd: wind direction

WSPM: wind speed (m/s)

station: name of the air-quality monitoring site

Size of the Dataset:
Number of attributes (columns) = 
Number of data samples (rows) / region = 
Number of Regions: 12
Total Instances = 18 * 35064 * 12 = 7,573,824
